   <h2> My Ribbeting Day! - A Game Made on Scratch </h2> 
  <iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/483822714/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p> This is a story game made with Scratch. There is some user interaction involved where your objective is to click on certain sprites a specific number of times. 
  This was the first "coding" assignment we had in the class. Hopefully, you can see the quality of work start to improve as you move throughout all the different apps and projects.
   For more information about the app, click the button below to open up a Google Doc containing a mock AP CSP write up about the game.

  <h2> Diversify Your Music - 4-Screen App </h2>

  <p>  This was the second major project of the course. Our objective was to create an app where the user would be able to navigate through at least 4 different screens. 
    I decided to approach this by creating an app that will present the user with information about different musical genres and artists. </p>

  <h2> Avoid the Asteroids - Conditional App </h2>

  <p>  This was the third major coding assignment of the class. Our objective was to create an app that used conditional statements. I wanted to revisit creating a game so I decided to 
    take the requirement of a conditional statement and use it in a function to determine if a collision had occured between the user, represented by a rocketship, and the asteroid. The 
    conditional statement would determine if this had occured and what the program would do as a result. For more information about the app, click the button below to open up a Google Doc
    containing a mock AP CSP write up </p>

 <h2> Exploring Today's Top Hits- AP CSP Project for the AP Exam </h2>
 <iframe width="352" height="620" style="border: 0px;" src="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/t_NPiKUf5oweffeQTxx7klIQu-Ec0z8Yea23LVbAlbR/embed?nosource"></iframe>
 <p>  This was the final major coding assignment of the class and the project that was used for the College Board digital project.
   Our objective was to incorporate all of the concepts we learned in the class into an app. This including using conditional statments, 
   lists, variables, screen, and much more. For more information about the app, click the button below to open up a Google Doc
    containing the AP CSP write up about the code. </p>
