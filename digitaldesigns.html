      <p> This is the completed digital design that my team did. This includes design elements that were created by other people in my group (note: the stars, the moon, and the buildings) 
      Everytime you reset the embedded demo, you will get a unique digital design that shows a Night-time City Skyline. Our objective with this digital design assignment was to create a program that
      will display random and unique variations of a design every time it is run.

      <p> This is embedded demo showcases the design element that I was responsible for. I wrote code that enable the program to have a random sky color, cloud color, and cloud size and amount.
       For more information about the program and what I wrote in my code, click the button below to open up a Google Doc containing a mock AP CSP write up about the digital design.
